# Basic Student Management Project

This is a basic student management project implemented with Python and Flask. It allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a CSV file that stores student information. Each student has a name, course, and grade, and the information is managed through a web interface.
## Features

-. **Student View:** Displays a list of students on the home page.
-. **Add Student:** Allows adding a new student with their name, course, and grade.
-. **Edit Student:** Modifies the information of an existing student.
-. **Delete Student:** Removes a student from the list.
-. **CSV Storage:** Student data is saved in a registro.csv file
## Requirements
